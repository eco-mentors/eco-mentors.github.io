    <h1>Break 90 Blueprint: 6-Week Strategy Plan</h1>
    <p>The 6-Week Plan is a structured system to build confidence, sharpen skills, and develop course strategy. Each week has a clear theme, guided club focus, and mindset objective — preparing you to break 90 with purpose, not luck.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Week 1: Contact & Accuracy</strong> – PW, 7i — Build a consistent strike pattern using face spray or foot powder.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 2: Distance Control</strong> – 8i, 9i, 54° — Practice three distances with clean setup and tempo.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 3: Mid-Iron Strategy</strong> – 6i, 3H — Emphasize large targets and GIR setups.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 4: Short Game Focus</strong> – GW, SW, Putter — Master basic chips, lags, and pressure drills.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 5: Pressure Reps</strong> – 4H, 5i, 3W — Simulate scoring drills and full-on course tactics.</li>
        <li><strong>Week 6: Challenge Round</strong> – Play, track, reflect, grow. Use best clubs by dispersion.</li>
    </ul>
