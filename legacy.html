    <h1>Legacy by Design: Lead Beyond the Scorecard</h1>
    <p>Legacy isn’t what you leave behind — it’s how you lead today. It’s the standard you live by, the example you set, and the change you inspire in others.</p>

    <h2>Your Core Legacy Pillars</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrity in Action</strong> – Doing what’s right when no one is watching</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline Under Pressure</strong> – Staying grounded in values when challenged</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Through Challenge</strong> – Using adversity to build wisdom</li>
        <li><strong>Impact with Intention</strong> – Leading people, not just processes</li>
        <li><strong>Leaving Spaces Better</strong> – Whether it’s a team, a tee box, or a life</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mentorship Philosophy</h2>
    <p>“Mentorship is leadership in its most personal form.”</p>
    <p>I mentor through presence, not perfection. Through shared effort, honest feedback, and the unwavering belief that every person has a gift they’re still discovering.</p>

    <h2>Reflection Prompts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Who am I influencing — even if I never speak to them directly?</li>
        <li>How do I define excellence on my terms?</li>
        <li>What part of my story is someone else’s survival guide?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Call to Action</h2>
    <p>Legacy isn’t built someday. It’s built right now — through decisions, relationships, and habits.<br><br><strong>Live it. Lead it. Pass it on.</strong></p>
